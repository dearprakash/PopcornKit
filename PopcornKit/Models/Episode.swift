 Struct for managing episode objects.
 
 **Important**: All images are `nil` unless episode was loaded from trakt. An image is obtained by calling `getEpisodeMetadata:showId:episodeNumber:seasonNumber:completion:` on `TraktManager`. Once image is obtained only the `largeBackgroundImage` variable should be set; the other two are computed and are not settable - they will be automatically updated once `largeBackgroundImage` is set.
